    "### a. Help someone working in a non-HPC domain understand / predict how useful a particular machine is to solving their problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Report a machine-independent measure of performance, to allow for fair comparison and portability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Have an algorithm-independent statement of what the problem is (i.e. phrased in terms of inputs and outputs), to avoid artificially constraining the implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### d. Be as simple as possible, so that the results of the benchmark are explainable and reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these criteria in mind, you are welcome to select any accepted community benchmark with an open-source implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The benchmark implementation must be *open*, so that we may see what exactly is being run.\n",
    "- An \"accepted community\" benchmark should ideally have a website describing itself, publishd benchmark results, and (ideally) a peer-reviewed in-depth description.\n",

    "- a. Describe some applications where the benchmark problem is relevant.  Benchmarks must walk a fine line between being to specific to one application but very predictive, versus being general to lots of applications while being too simple to predict the performance of any application very well.  Do you think the benchmark you chose does a good job with this balance?\n",
    "\n",
    "- b. What assumptions does your benchmark make about the kind of machine that it is run on?  Do you think that those assumptions are reasonable?  Let's make this question very concrete: let's say you have access to [TaihuLight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunway_TaihuLight), whose nodes are neither really CPUs or GPUs, but somewhere in between.  Could your benchmark run on this machine?  If not, propose a way that you could change the benchmark to make it more portable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- c. How exactly does your benchmark specify the way the problem is solved?  If your benchmark is for a particular algorithm or a particular code, do you think that the results of the benchmark would help you predict the performance of a different code/algorithm solving the same problem on the same machine?\n",
    "\n",
    "- d. One measure of the complexity of a benchmark is how difficult it would be to write a reference implementation from scratch (one that solves the problem, if not in a \"high-performance\" way).  If you had to guess, how big would a team have to be do that: (i) one dedicated programmer; (ii) a team of about a dozen (like a research lab); (iii) an Organization (like a division of a company or a government agency)?
