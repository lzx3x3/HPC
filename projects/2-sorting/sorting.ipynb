    "```\n",
    "  - The small library comes with some logging and error macros (see\n",
    "      [proj2.h](proj2.h)) as well as an interface for obtaining/restoring workspace\n",
    "      arrays (see `Proj2SorterGetWorkArray()` and `Proj2SorterRestoreWorkArray()` in\n",
    "      [proj2sorter.h](proj2sorter.h).  To be memory neutral, restore every\n",
    "      workspace that you get.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Functioning parallel implementations have been provided, one based on\n",
    "      [quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort#Parallelization) and\n",
    "      one base on [bitonic mergesort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter).\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A [template library](https://github.com/swenson/sort) originated by Chris\n",
    "      Swenson has been imported for a quicksort implementation that is faster\n",
    "      than `qsort` from the standard library.  The template library includes\n",
    "      other implementations that you are welcome to explore.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      If you go through the work of bringing in a serial sorting library, you're welcome to use it,\n",
    "      as long as you put it somewhere the TA and I can access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Indeed, as with previous assignments, the implementation details are up\n",
    "      to you.  There is a test program\n",
    "      ([test_proj2.c](test_proj2.c)), which may not be edited, that calls your\n",
    "      library.  It will test the sorting bandwidth (bytes sorted per second) of\n",
    "      your code on random data at varying numbers of *keys\n",
    "      per MPI process* (a *key* in our library is just a `uint64_t`: a large\n",
    "      integer).  You may incorporate additional files into your library by\n",
    "      adding a `Makefile.inc` file to your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    ./test_proj2 MIN_KEYS_PER_PROCESS MAX_KEYS_PER_PROCESS MULTIPLIER SEED NUM_REPS UNIFORM_SIZE UNIFORM_KEYS PARTIALLY_SORTED\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the test program seeds the random number generator with `SEED`,\n",
    "starts with `MIN_KEYS_PER_PROCESS`, tests `NUM_REPS` times to get an average,\n",
    "and gets the next problem size by multiplying by `MULTIPLIER`, until at most\n",
    "`MAX_KEYS_PER_PROCESS`.  If `UNIFORM_SIZE` is `0`, then the number of keys per process will vary between `MIN_KEYS_PER_PROCESS` and `2*MIN_KEYS_PER_PROCESS`. IF `UNIFORM_KEYS` is `0`, each process will have a keys in its own randomly chosen interval.  If `PARTIALLY_SORTED` is `1`, the input array is random but generally increasing; if `PARTIALLY_SORTED` is `-1` the input array is random but generally decreasing.  In your testing, you will probably want to test **one\n",
