If two particles are not touching (that is if their centers are more than $2r$ apart), then the interactions can safely be ignored (particularly if it will be drowned out relative to the background *Brownian* noise that we saw last week).  In side of $2r$, then the overlapping particles start pushing each other apart.\n",

    "### Although the test case running time is a little small, loading module actually takes much time, but if we scrutinize into the computational part, we could easily detect that whenever the code involves using ```IXGetPairs```a significant percentage of computation time will be consumed, this led my attention to ```interaction.c``` and concluded that  ```interction.c``` needs parallization most to speed up the process. \n",
    "\n",
    "### However, other codes need to be examined as well, to make sure we can put the maximum parallelization to the code and achieve a more optimal speed, following ```Amdahl's law```.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some loops are looping around N_P which may only contributes a trivial performance improvement if parallelization takes place, I tried to make them parallel as well to see if parallelization actually improve or lower the performance, and noticed that if the N_P loops with some serilization critical parts, actually parallelization on those can slow the code with my current setting, but some code not relating the serialization critical parts are usually faster after modification. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The loops take significant time are the loops associating the pairs. Those type of loops consume a lot computation and must be parallelized. \n",
    "\n",
    "### While Scrutinizing the ```interaction.c```, the main target loop is the ```IXGetPairs```, I tested several ```for``` loops within this function and the one with the largest impact is the pairs interactions calculation part, which involves calculating the particles within the box and the particles in neighboring boxes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Using this part of code as an example, I started using ```#pragma omp parallel for collapse(3)``` on a three nested ```for``` loops to collapse them into one.  And specify clauses following with ```default(shared)``` and ```private(p1,p2,d2,dx,dy,dz,idx,idy,idz,bp,neigh_idx,neigh_idy,neigh_idz,neigh_bp)``` to specify each threads' shared and private variables, to avoid the segmentation fault error. And there are steps containing ``` IXPushPair(ix,p1,p2);```which is the function that called to update the pairs, for this part I added a protection using```#pragma omp critical``` to make sure the update is protected when it happened. \n",
    "\n",
    "### A similar scrutinizing method is used to other codes, for example, in the ```accelerate.c```, there is a loop involving looping through the pairs, so I made sure to parallelize that part as well. The way I parallelized it is using a ```#pragma omp parallel for``` before ```for (int p = 0; p < Npairs; p++)```, and I made sure ```IDX(U,d,i) += du[d];``` and ```IDX(U,d,j) -= du[d];``` are protected when updating, using ```#pragma omp atomic update``` on each one of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### I also noticed that besides those two major changes that will affect the speed a lot, increasing the ```boxdim``` to ```8``` is also ramping up the speed dramatically. This might be due to the ```boxdim = 8``` will let the cache be packed more efficiently, I tried with different numbers over ```8```, but ```8``` works best in my code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Besides those changes, parallelizations also made on other parts where parallelization can happen but not going to slow down the speed overall. I made comments to those changes in the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "### And I decided to use 14 cores, as the CPU I selected has 28 cores, but 14 are physical cores. Choosing 14 cores can have better memeory locality. And I have the ```OMP_PROC_BIND = spread``` to spread threads evenly to the 2 sockets. \n"

    "## Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "- **My experience in the past:** Detailed git histories are correlated with better performance!\n",
    "- **Understand your code before you try to change it:**\n",
    "    - In addition to profiling utilities, it might be useful to add timers to\n",
    "      individual routines.  The division of the program into objects that control\n",
    "      different aspects of the code should make easy to, say, add a timer\n",
    "      in one place without changing the whole program.\n",
    "- **Simple problem parameters that can be changed:**\n",
    "    - The number of boxes per dimension\n",
    "    - The layout of vectors (array-of-structures or structure of arrays? see `vector.h`)\n",
    "    - The data structures used to assign particles to boxes (is a linked-list really best)?\n",
    "- **Avoid memory and other resource contention:**\n",
    "    - Anytime multiple threads are trying to write to locations close to each\n",
    "      other, it makes it difficult and expensive to make sure each thread has\n",
    "      an up-to-date copy of the memory that is changing.  This would happen,\n",
    "      for example, if many threads are writing to the `pairs` list in\n",
    "      the interactions routine.  Consider allocating a separate workspace for\n",
    "      each thread by, for example, giving each thread its own `pairs` array.\n",
    "      Then, once all threads are done computing their pairs, you can combine\n",
    "      the separate arrays into one array, or even change the interface of the\n",
    "      `interactions()` function so that it is multiple lists are returned.\n",
    "- **Find ways to avoid recomputing from scratch:**\n",
    "    - Can you use the layout of the particles from the last time step to help you\n",
    "      bin or find pairs in the next time step?\n",
    "- **You get to choose how many threads we use to evaluate your code:**\n",
    "    - There's nothing inherently wrong with achieving your best performance\n",
    "      using fewer than the maximum number of threads available on a node.  The\n",
    "      problem may simply not have enough concurrency to support every thread.\n",
    "- **Read through these performance slides for ideas:** [From Archer](https://www.archer.ac.uk/training/course-material/2015/12/ShMem_OpenMP_York/Slides/L09-performance.pdf)\n",
    "- **Reread the molecular dynamic notes from Prof. Chow to make sure you understand what we're trying to accomplish:** [Molecular dynamics and cell lists](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/%7Eechow/ipcc/hpc-course/05_celllist.pdf)"
