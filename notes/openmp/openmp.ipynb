    "For the purposes of performance in this class, there are a few basic things you want to know about the directives in openMP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you are not giving specific directions to each worker thread, the openMP runtime will make some *scheduling* decisions, about how the work should be divided.  You should be aware of what the default scheduling is for different directives, and how you can control it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whenever work is not embarrassingly parallel, threads will interact, which means that the *synchronization* behavior of directives becomes important:\n",
    "  - What is the policy of the directive for handling oversubscribed resources (such as concurrent writes to the same location)?\n",
    "  - Does the construct have any *implicit synchronization*, such as a barrier at the start or end of the scope of the directive?"

This is not possible with every style of parallelism in openMP (for example you can use openMP to set up a server/client type of parallelism which does not serialize), but is a useful guideline, particularly for debugging: if your program isn't doing the right thing without openMP, then the problem is elsewhere."
